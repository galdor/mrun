# mrun
## Introduction
This repository contains the mrun utility. MRrun executes one or more
instances of the same program in parallel and makes it easy to distinguish
between their outputs.

The original use case is the development of distributed programs: it should be
easy to spawn several copies of the same program, let them connect together
and see how they behave.

## Usage
See `mrun -h` for more information.
